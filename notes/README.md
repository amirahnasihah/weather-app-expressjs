# async/await Promises

To create a weather app using Express.js, Axios, and EJS, you'll need to follow several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement the features you mentioned:

1. Set Up Your Project:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project and install the required dependencies (Express.js, Axios, EJS).
   - Create an Express application and set up your project structure.

2. Obtain API Keys:
   - Sign up for an account and obtain API keys for both OpenMeteo and OpenCage.

3. Create a Controller for Weather Forecast:
   - Create a controller file (e.g., `weatherController.js`) to handle the logic for obtaining weather forecasts.
   - Import the necessary modules (Express, Axios) and set up the routes.

```javascript
// weatherController.js
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const router = express.Router();

// Define routes for weather information
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const location = req.query.location; // Extract location from the query string

    // Step 4: Use OpenCage API to geocode the location
    const geocodeData = await getGeocodeData(location);

    // Extract the latitude and longitude from geocodeData
    const { lat, lng } = geocodeData.results[0].geometry;

    // Step 5: Make requests to OpenMeteo API for hourly and current weather
    const weatherData = await getWeatherData(lat, lng);

    // Step 6: Create a template and render the weather information
    res.render('weather', { weatherData });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    res.status(500).send('An error occurred');
  }
});

// Function to get geocode data using OpenCage API
async function getGeocodeData(location) {
  // Use Axios to make a request to the OpenCage API
  const response = await axios.get(
    `https://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q=${location}&key=YOUR_OPENCAGE_API_KEY`
  );

  return response.data;
}

// Function to get weather data using OpenMeteo API
async function getWeatherData(lat, lng) {
  // Use Axios to make requests to OpenMeteo API for hourly and current weather
  // Replace 'YOUR_OPENMETEO_API_KEY' with your actual API key
  const currentWeatherResponse = await axios.get(
    `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${lat}&longitude=${lng}&current_weather=true&hourly=temperature_2m&daily=sunrise,sunset&timezone=auto&timezone_offset=auto&appid=YOUR_OPENMETEO_API_KEY`
  );

  return currentWeatherResponse.data;
}

module.exports = router;
```

4. Set Up Views (EJS Templates):
   - Create EJS templates for rendering weather information. These templates can be in a `views` folder.
   - Create a template (e.g., `weather.ejs`) that will display the weather data.

```html
<!-- views/weather.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Weather Forecast</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Weather Forecast for <%= weatherData.results.location %></h1>
  <div class="current-weather">
    <h2>Current Weather</h2>
    <p>Temperature: <%= weatherData.current.temperature %>°C</p>
    <!-- Add more current weather information here -->
  </div>
  <div class="hourly-weather">
    <h2>Hourly Weather</h2>
    <ul>
      <% weatherData.hourly.temperature_2m.forEach(temp => { %>
        <li><%= temp %>°C</li>
      <% }); %>
    </ul>
    <!-- Add more hourly weather information here -->
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

5. Set Up Express to Use EJS:
   - Configure Express to use EJS as the view engine.

```javascript
// In your main app file (e.g., app.js)
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Set the view engine to EJS
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// Use the weather controller
const weatherController = require('./weatherController');
app.use('/weather', weatherController);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

6. Run Your App:
   - Start your Express application using `node app.js` (or your main app file).

Now, when you visit `http://localhost:3000/weather?location=YourLocation`, your app will make requests to the OpenCage API to geocode the location, then use the coordinates to fetch weather data from the OpenMeteo API. Finally, it will render the weather data in your EJS template. Don't forget to replace `'YOUR_OPENCAGE_API_KEY'` and `'YOUR_OPENMETEO_API_KEY'` with your actual API keys.

## Explanation

The code you provided is for a Node.js Express application that serves weather information using data from the OpenCage API and the OpenMeteo API. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It imports the required modules, including Express for handling HTTP requests and responses, and Axios for making HTTP requests.

2. It defines a router using Express's `Router` class.

3. The main route is defined for handling HTTP GET requests to the root path ('/'). When a GET request is made to this endpoint, the code inside the `async` function is executed.

4. It extracts the "location" query parameter from the request, which is expected to be provided by the client.

5. The `getGeocodeData` function is called to obtain geocode data for the provided location using the OpenCage API. This function makes an asynchronous HTTP request to the OpenCage API and returns the geocode data.

6. The latitude and longitude are extracted from the geocode data to be used in the next step.

7. The `getWeatherData` function is called to obtain weather data for the specific latitude and longitude using the OpenMeteo API. This function makes an asynchronous HTTP request to the OpenMeteo API and returns the current weather data.

8. The weather data is passed to an Express template called "weather" and then rendered as a response. It's assumed that you have a template engine configured in your Express application for rendering HTML templates.

9. If any errors occur during the process, an error message is logged to the console, and a 500 Internal Server Error response is sent to the client.

10. The `getGeocodeData` and `getWeatherData` functions are defined further down in the code. They use Axios to make HTTP requests to the respective APIs, and you need to replace 'YOUR_OPENCAGE_API_KEY' and 'YOUR_OPENMETEO_API_KEY' with your actual API keys.

This code is designed to handle a route that takes a location as a query parameter, retrieves geocode data for that location, and then fetches current weather data for that location. It then renders this weather data using a template engine for display to the user.

## More information

### are getGeocodeData() and getWeatherData() callback functions? can you explain more about this basic function passed and arguments. the flow of execution and anything that relates? Is this basic functions that must need to understand?

The `getGeocodeData()` and `getWeatherData()` functions are not callback functions in the traditional sense. Instead, **they are asynchronous functions that return Promises**, and they are typically used with the `async/await` syntax to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and structured manner. These functions are essential in the code you provided as they are responsible for making HTTP requests to external APIs and retrieving data. Here's an explanation of these functions and their role in the code:

1. `getGeocodeData(location)`: This function takes a `location` argument, which is the location for which you want to obtain geocode data. It is an asynchronous function and uses the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until the Promise returned by the `axios.get` call is resolved.

   - `axios.get` is used to make an HTTP GET request to the OpenCage API, providing the `location` as a query parameter. The API key should be provided in the URL as well.
   - The function returns the Promise returned by `axios.get`, which resolves to the response data received from the API.

2. `getWeatherData(lat, lng)`: This function takes two arguments, `lat` and `lng`, which are the latitude and longitude coordinates obtained from the geocode data. Like `getGeocodeData()`, it is an asynchronous function.

   - `axios.get` is used to make an HTTP GET request to the OpenMeteo API, providing the latitude and longitude as query parameters. Again, you need to provide an API key in the URL.
   - The function returns the Promise returned by `axios.get`, which resolves to the response data received from the OpenMeteo API.

The flow of execution is as follows:

1. When a GET request is made to the `/` route, the code inside the route handler function is executed.
2. It extracts the `location` query parameter from the request.
3. It calls `getGeocodeData(location)` to obtain geocode data. The execution of the route handler pauses at this point until the Promise returned by `getGeocodeData()` is resolved.
4. Once the geocode data is obtained, it extracts the latitude and longitude.
5. It calls `getWeatherData(lat, lng)` to obtain weather data, again waiting for the Promise to be resolved.
6. Finally, the weather data is rendered and sent as a response to the client.

Understanding these functions is important because they handle the actual data retrieval from external APIs, and the flow of execution is structured around asynchronous operations. Using `async/await` makes the code easier to read and maintain, as it avoids callback hell and allows for a more sequential flow of code even when dealing with asynchronous tasks.

### what is the Promise in both functions?

In both the `getGeocodeData(location)` and `getWeatherData(lat, lng)` functions, the `Promise` is returned by the `axios.get` function, which is a common pattern when working with asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

Here's a breakdown of how Promises are used in these functions:

1. `getGeocodeData(location)`:

   ```javascript
   async function getGeocodeData(location) {
     // Use Axios to make a request to the OpenCage API
     const response = await axios.get(
       `https://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?q=${location}&key=YOUR_OPENCAGE_API_KEY`
     );

     return response.data;
   }
   ```

   In this function:
   - `axios.get` makes an asynchronous HTTP request to the OpenCage API.
   - `await` is used to pause the execution of the function until the Promise returned by `axios.get` is resolved. While waiting, the event loop is free to handle other tasks.
   - **When the Promise is resolved (i.e., when the HTTP request completes and data is received), the `.then()` block implicitly resolves with the `response` object.**
   - The function returns `response.data`, which is the data received from the API.

2. `getWeatherData(lat, lng)`:

   ```javascript
   async function getWeatherData(lat, lng) {
     // Use Axios to make requests to OpenMeteo API for weather data
     const currentWeatherResponse = await axios.get(
       `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${lat}&longitude=${lng}&...`
     );

     return currentWeatherResponse.data;
   }
   ```

   In this function:
   - Similarly, `axios.get` makes an asynchronous HTTP request to the OpenMeteo API.
   - `await` is used to pause the function's execution until the Promise returned by `axios.get` is resolved.
   - When the Promise is resolved, the function returns `currentWeatherResponse.data`, which contains the data received from the OpenMeteo API.

In both cases, **`axios.get` returns a Promise that represents the asynchronous HTTP request**. The **`await` keyword is used to wait for the resolution of the Promise and obtain the response data when it's available**. This allows you to write asynchronous code in a more linear, sequential manner, making it easier to work with asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

#  `hourly.time.map((forecastTime, index) => {..}`

```javascript
hourly.time.slice(0, 4).map((time, index) => {
  const localTime = new Date(time).toLocaleTimeString()
  const temperature = hourly.temperature_2m[index]

  console.log(`Hourly: ${localTime} || ${temperature}${hourly_units.temperature_2m} `)
})
```

In the code you provided, the `.map()` function is used to iterate over the `hourly.time` array, and for each element in that array, a function is executed. The function takes two parameters: `forecastTime` and `index`.

Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. `hourly.time` is an array of timestamps.

2. The `.map()` function is called on this array, which means it will loop through each element of the array.

3. Inside the `.map()` function, you define a function that takes two parameters. The first parameter, `forecastTime`, represents the current element in the `hourly.time` array as it iterates through. The second parameter, `index`, represents the index of the current element in the array.

So, as the `.map()` function iterates over the `hourly.time` array, it provides each timestamp (i.e., `forecastTime`) and its corresponding index (i.e., `index`) to the function you defined. In your code, you use these parameters to convert the timestamp into a local time and to retrieve the temperature value from the `hourly.temperature_2m` array at the same index.

For example, during the first iteration, `forecastTime` would be `"2023-10-15T00:00"` and `index` would be `0`. During the second iteration, `forecastTime` would be `"2023-10-15T01:00"` and `index` would be `1`, and so on.

This allows you to work with both the timestamp and the corresponding temperature value in the `hourly.temperature_2m` array for each time slot, making it easier to display the data as you desire.

In summary, the `(forecastTime, index)` syntax within the `.map()` function is a way to receive and work with the current element and its index in the array being mapped over.

## why we iterate `hourly.time` but not `hourly.temperature_2m`?

In the code you provided, you iterate over `hourly.time` and not `hourly.temperature_2m` because you want to display temperature data at specific times. The `hourly.time` array contains timestamps that correspond to specific hours, while the `hourly.temperature_2m` array contains the temperature values corresponding to those timestamps.

By iterating over `hourly.time` and using the index to access the corresponding temperature values in `hourly.temperature_2m`, you can pair the timestamp with the temperature value for each specific time. This allows you to display the temperature at each hour or time slot, making it easier to present the data in a structured and meaningful way.

If you were to iterate over `hourly.temperature_2m` directly, you wouldn't have a convenient way to associate each temperature value with its corresponding time, and the resulting output wouldn't provide the context of when each temperature reading was taken. Therefore, iterating over `hourly.time` and using the index to access temperature values from `hourly.temperature_2m` is a common approach to work with time-series data where you want to maintain the time context.

## explain the logic behind this line, `(time, index)` (IMPORTANT)

The code you provided is meant to extract and display the hourly temperature data for the first 4 hours in the `hourly` dataset. Here's an explanation of the logic behind the code, especially the part `(time, index)`:

1. `hourly.time.slice(0, 4)` - This part of the code takes the first 4 elements of the `hourly.time` array. The `slice(0, 4)` function is used to extract the elements at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3. These elements represent the timestamps for the first 4 hours.

2. `.map((time, index) => { ... })` - The `.map()` function is then used to iterate over these 4 timestamps. In this case, it takes a function with two parameters: `time` and `index`. Here's how this part works:
   
   - `time`: This parameter represents the current element in the `hourly.time` array as it iterates through. In this code, `time` holds the timestamp for each hour in the selected range (e.g., '2023-10-17T00:00' for the first iteration).
   
   - `index`: This parameter represents the index of the current element in the array. The first timestamp, '2023-10-17T00:00', is at index 0, the second timestamp at index 1, and so on.

3. Inside the `.map()` function, the code does the following for each timestamp in the selected range:

   - `const localTime = new Date(time).toLocaleTimeString()` - This line converts the timestamp to a local time format using `new Date(time).toLocaleTimeString()`. It takes the timestamp (e.g., '2023-10-17T00:00') and converts it to the local time format (e.g., '12:00:00 AM').

   - `const temperature = hourly.temperature_2m[index]` - This line retrieves the temperature value from the `hourly.temperature_2m` array at the same index as the current timestamp. This ensures that the temperature value corresponds to the timestamp.

   - `console.log(...)` - Finally, the code prints the local time and temperature for each of the selected timestamps. For example, it will print something like: "Hourly: 12:00:00 AM || 27.1°C" for the first timestamp.

In summary, the code selects the first 4 timestamps in the `hourly` dataset, converts their timestamps to local time, and pairs each local time with the corresponding temperature value to display hourly temperature data for those hours.

## to list out both time and temperature, we passed what actually?

In the code provided:

```javascript
hourly.time.slice(0, 4).map((time, index) => {
  const localTime = new Date(time).toLocaleTimeString();
  const temperature = hourly.temperature_2m[index];

  console.log(`Hourly: ${localTime} || ${temperature}${hourly_units.temperature_2m}`);
});
```

The `.map()` function iterates over the first 4 timestamps in the `hourly.time` array. In each iteration, it passes two parameters to the callback function:

1. `time`: This parameter represents the current element in the `hourly.time` array, which is the timestamp for a specific hour (e.g., '2023-10-17T00:00' for the first iteration).

2. `index`: This parameter represents the index of the current element in the array. The first timestamp is at index 0, the second timestamp at index 1, and so on.

With these parameters, the code can pair the timestamp (`time`) with the corresponding temperature value from the `hourly.temperature_2m` array using the same index (`index`). This allows the code to list out both the local time and the temperature for the first 4 hours in the `hourly` dataset.
